# Titanic-Survival-prediction-from-Kaggle
analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

The step one is to provide data analysis and prepare the data for data modeling from data anamolies
STEP 1 - the file data preparation consists of step to prepare the data for modeling
STEP 2 - Modeling for final preparation using Logistic regression consists of data modeling technique for prediction of survival of titanic passengers
